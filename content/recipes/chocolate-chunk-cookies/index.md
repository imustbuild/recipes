  - item: "flaky sea salt"
    amount: "for topping"

instructions:
  - "Brown the butter: In a light-colored saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling occasionally, until butter foams, turns golden brown, and smells nutty (5-7 minutes). Pour into a large bowl and let cool for 15 minutes."
  - "Whisk flour, baking soda, and fine sea salt in a medium bowl."
  - "Add both sugars to the cooled brown butter. Whisk until smooth and slightly thickened, about 1 minute."
  - "Add eggs one at a time, whisking well after each. Whisk in vanilla."
  - "Add flour mixture all at once. Fold with a spatula until just combined - don't overmix."
  - "Fold in chocolate chunks. The dough will be soft."
  - "Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 3 days). This step is essential for thick, chewy cookies."
  - "When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheets with parchment."
  - "Scoop 2-tablespoon portions of dough, spacing 3 inches apart."
  - "Bake 10-12 minutes until edges are golden but centers look slightly underdone."
  - "Immediately sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack."

notes: "For extra-thick cookies, freeze scooped dough balls for 30 minutes before baking. Dough can be frozen for up to 3 months - bake directly from frozen, adding 2-3 minutes to bake time."

These are **the** chocolate chip cookies. The brown butter adds an incredible depth of flavor that takes these from good to unforgettable.

## The Science

- **Brown butter** = Maillard reaction = nutty, caramel-like flavor
- **Chilling the dough** = solidifies the fat = cookies spread less = thicker result  
- **Underbaking slightly** = carryover cooking = gooey centers

The 1-hour chill time is non-negotiable. I know, I know. But trust me. The cookies will be significantly better.
