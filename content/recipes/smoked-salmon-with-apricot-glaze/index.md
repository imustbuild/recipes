ingredients:
  - item: "salmon filet"
    amount: "1 large"
  - item: "brown sugar"
    amount: "2 cups"
  - item: "kosher salt"
    amount: "1/4 cup"

    amount: "1/2 cup"

instructions:
  - "Rinse salmon in cold water, checking for bones. Cut into fourths and pat dry."
  - "In a bowl, mix sugar, salt, and pepper for dry brine."
  - "In a 9x13 glass dish spread a handful of brine, then layer with fish and more brine. Repeat until fish is covered in brine. Cover with plastic wrap trying to remove as much air as possible. Refrigerate overnight."
  - "5 hours before eating, remove fish from brine and rinse and pat dry."
  - "Let rest on a rack in open air for 2 hours to develop pellicle."
  - "Smoke at 150°F for 1.5 hours. Brush apricot preserves on fish. Continue smoking for 45 minutes until fish reaches 145°F in its thickest pieces."

notes: "The pellicle (tacky surface that forms during air-drying) is crucial for smoke adhesion. Don't skip this step! Total time includes overnight brine."

This smoked salmon is a showstopper. The dry brine draws out moisture and seasons the fish deeply, while the apricot glaze adds a beautiful sweet finish.

## Timing

- **Day before**: Brine the salmon overnight (8-12 hours)
- **Day of**: 
  - 5 hours before serving: Remove from brine, rinse, pat dry
  - 3 hours before serving: Air dry to form pellicle
  - 2.25 hours before serving: Start smoking

The process takes planning but very little active time.
