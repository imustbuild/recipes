    amount: "3 tablespoons"
  - item: "apple cider vinegar"
    amount: "3 tablespoons"
  - item: "fish sauce"
    amount: "2 tablespoons"

instructions:
  - "Rub the pork cubes generously with Sperry's seasoning."
  - "Heat oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Sear the pork on all sides and move to the slow cooker."
  - "In the same pan, add the onions, peppers, and garlic, then cook, occasionally stirring, until they are sweet and browned around the edges."
  - "Stir in the tomato paste, chili powder, and cumin. Cook, stirring, until the tomato paste turns from bright red to orange, about 3 minutes."
  - "Add the apple cider vinegar and fish sauce and cook for about 1 minute, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan."
  - "Pour the onion and spice mixture over the pork, then move the pork around the bottom of the slow cooker so that some of the onion and spice mixture slides underneath."
  - "Seal the slow cooker with its lid and cook until very tender, LOW for 6 to 8 hours or HIGH for 4 to 6 hours."
  - "Turn off the slow cooker and transfer the pork to a cutting board. If the pork has a bone in it, remove and discard it. Use two forks to shred the meat, discarding any connective tissue and large clumps of fat."
  - "Remove the cooking liquid and skim most of the fat from its surface. Discard the fat, and then set aside the cooking liquid."
  - "If using barbecue sauce, add it to the slow cooker and stir in the shredded pork. For even more flavor, add back some of the reserved cooking liquid. If you're not using barbecue sauce, add the shredded pork and the cooking liquid to the slow cooker. Then, taste and season with salt, vinegar, or hot sauce."

notes: "The fish sauce is the secret ingredient - it adds umami depth without any fishy taste. You can substitute soy sauce if needed."

This pulled pork is incredibly versatile. Great for sandwiches, tacos, nachos, or just served over rice.

## Tips

- Searing the pork first creates a flavorful crust and adds depth to the final dish
- Don't skip the step of cooking down the tomato paste - it removes the raw taste
- The cooking liquid is liquid gold - save it for adding back to the meat or for other recipes
