The broiler is the secret weapon here. It caramelizes the honey glaze into something magical while keeping the salmon perfectly moist.

## Tips for Perfect Salmon

- Let the salmon come to room temperature for 15 minutes before cooking
- Don't move the fish once it hits the pan - let it develop that crust
- The fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork
